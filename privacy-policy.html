      <h1>Privacy Policy for Kudoro</h1>

      <p class="privacy-policy-date"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 29.06.2025</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to the Kudoro app, which is developed and maintained by Timon Lapawczyk.
        Kudoro does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users.
        The app is provided “as is” and used entirely at your own risk.
        For questions or concerns, please contact
        <a href="mailto:kudoro.cc@gmail.com">kudoro.cc@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>What information does Kudoro obtain and how is it used?</h2>
      <p>
        Kudoro does not collect or store any personal data on its own. Strava
        activity data is only accessed if you connect your Strava account, and
        it is processed entirely on your device.
      </p>

      <h2>Data from Strava</h2>
      
      <p>
          Strava data is accessed through the <a href="https://developers.strava.com/" target="_blank">official Strava API</a>, using explicit
          authorization.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kudoro has access to both public and private activities from your Strava account.
      </p>

      <p>
          This data is processed entirely on your device and is never uploaded
          to Kudoro servers or shared with third parties.
      </p>

      <p>
          It is in the nature of the generated overlays that they include activity
          data. These overlays are stored only on your device. <strong>Choosing
          who to share them with is entirely up to you</strong> - for example,
          through social media, messaging apps, or any other method.
      </p>

      <p>
        Access to Strava can be revoked at any time through Kudoro’s settings.
      </p>

      <h2>Does Kudoro collect precise real-time location information?</h2>
      <p>Kudoro does not collect precise information about the location of your device.</p>

      <h2>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by Kudoro?</h2>
      <p>
        Kudoro does not knowingly collect or share any personal data. However,
        some third-party libraries used by Kudoro may collect certain data
        automatically as part of their normal operation (e.g., crash reporting or
        analytics). No such data is shared by Kudoro with any third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        For details on third-party technologies used, please see the
        <strong>Third-Party Technologies</strong> section below.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        Kudoro uses certain third-party libraries and technologies to provide its
        features. Information about these third-party technologies can be found
        in the About section of the app.
      </p>

      <h2>What are opt-out rights?</h2>
      <p>
        All data collection can be stopped by uninstalling Kudoro using the
        standard uninstall processes available as part of your device or app
        store.
