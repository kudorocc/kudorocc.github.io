      <h1>Privacy Policy for Kudoro</h1>

      <p class="privacy-policy-date">
        <strong>Effective date:</strong> 16.02.2026
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to the Kudoro app, which is developed and
        maintained by Klippros Studios AB. Kudoro does not collect, store, or
        transmit personal data to its own servers. Most processing happens on
        the user's device. Certain subscription-related data is processed by
        third-party providers (Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and
        RevenueCat) as described below. The app is provided “as is” and
        used entirely at your own risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kudoro does not use analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or any
        data-collecting SDKs, except as described in this policy for Strava and
        subscription management via RevenueCat. For questions or concerns,
        please contact
        <a href="mailto:kudoro@klippros.com">kudoro@klippros.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>What information does Kudoro obtain and how is it used?</h2>
      <p>
        Kudoro does not collect personal information beyond what is necessary
        to provide its features. Most processing happens on your device.
        Subscription-related information is processed by third-party providers
        as described in the &quot;Subscriptions and RevenueCat&quot; section.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app may access the following types of data:
      </p>

      <h3>Media library</h3>
      <p>
        Kudoro may request access to your device's media library (photos and
        videos) so you can create overlays with your own content. This data is
        only accessed with your permission, processed entirely on your device,
        and never transmitted to Kudoro servers or third parties. Any content
        you generate (e.g., overlays) is stored only on your device; it is up
        to you to share it.
      </p>

      <h3>Data from Strava</h3>
      <p>
        Strava activity data, profile information, and related data are
        accessed only with your explicit authorization via the
        <a href="https://developers.strava.com/" target="_blank"
          >official Strava API</a
        >. Kudoro has access to both public and private activities from your
        Strava account when you choose to connect.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Strava data is processed on-device and never transmitted to Kudoro
        servers or third parties. Users may revoke access at any time in
        Kudoro's settings or via
        <a href="https://www.strava.com/settings/apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strava settings</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is in the nature of the generated overlays that they include
        activity data. These overlays are stored only on your device.
        <strong>Choosing who to share them with is entirely up to you,</strong>
        for example, through social media, messaging apps, or any other method.
      </p>

      <h3>Subscriptions and RevenueCat</h3>
      <p>
        Kudoro uses RevenueCat to manage in-app subscriptions through the Apple
        App Store and Google Play Store. The following data is processed by
        RevenueCat and Apple/Google to provide subscription functionality:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Subscription status (active/inactive)</li>
        <li>Renewal date and purchase history for the Pro tier</li>
        <li>Device or RevenueCat identifiers used to link purchases</li>
        <li>Locale and currency information for display purposes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Subscriptions are auto-renewing unless canceled by the user via Apple
        or Google. Kudoro does not access or store your payment information,
        email, or personal account details.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app displays subscription status, renewal date, and provides a
        Restore Purchases button. Users cannot cancel subscriptions within the
        app but are given instructions for managing subscriptions through Apple
        or Google accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        RevenueCat processes subscription data to manage purchases, restore
        access, synchronize subscription status across devices, and provide
        subscription reporting to the developer. Kudoro does not use
        advertising, behavioral tracking, or user profiling analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
        RevenueCat and the respective app store may generate and store
        pseudonymous customer identifiers (such as an App User ID), country
        information, subscription history, transaction dates, and total spend
        related to your subscription. Kudoro may access this subscription-related
        information through the RevenueCat dashboard for revenue reporting and
        limited customer support purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        RevenueCat and the respective app stores act as independent data
        controllers for subscription processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        These records are pseudonymous and do not include your name, email
        address, payment details, or other directly identifying information.
        Kudoro does not combine this data with other datasets and cannot
        directly identify individual users.
      </p>

      <h3>Location data</h3>
      <p>
        Kudoro does not use any location data whatsoever.
      </p>

      <h3>Local Storage</h3>
      <p>
        Kudoro stores app settings and cached data locally on your device to
        improve performance. This data never leaves your device.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by
        Kudoro?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Kudoro does not share any information with third parties except as
        described in the Third-Party Services section below.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Kudoro interacts with external services for essential features:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Strava API:</strong> Accessed only if you choose to connect
        your Strava account. All data is processed on-device and is never
        transmitted to Kudoro servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used for subscription management.
        RevenueCat processes subscription status, purchase history,
        pseudonymous identifiers, country information, transaction dates, and
        total spend to enable subscription functionality and reporting. Kudoro
        does not receive payment details, names, email addresses, or other
        directly identifying information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kudoro does not use analytics, advertising SDKs, crash reporting
        services, or any other data-collecting SDKs.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights &amp; Opt-Out</h2>
      <p>
        Since Kudoro does not collect or transmit personal data to its own
        servers, you may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revoke Strava access at any time through the app settings or via <a href="https://www.strava.com/settings/apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strava settings</a></li>
        <li>Revoke media library access in your device settings</li>
        <li>Restore purchases using the RevenueCat button</li>
        <li>Cancel subscriptions via Apple or Google account settings</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app to remove all locally stored data</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
      <p>
        Kudoro primarily processes data locally on your device.
        Subscription-related data is processed externally by Apple App Store,
        Google Play Store, and RevenueCat for payment handling and
        subscription management. Kudoro does not receive directly identifying
        personal information from these providers. The legal basis for any
        processing is your explicit consent when you grant media library
        access, connect your Strava account, or use subscriptions. You may
        withdraw this consent at any time by revoking permissions or
        uninstalling the app.
      </p>

      <h2>GDPR (European Economic Area and United Kingdom)</h2>

      </p>
      <ul>

Subscription-related data is processed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple App Store</a>, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat</a> in accordance with their respective privacy policies.</li>
        <li>You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or port your data. You can exercise these rights by revoking Strava and media library access, deleting generated content, and uninstalling the app.</li>
        <li>You also have the right to object to processing, withdraw consent at any time, and lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For requests or complaints, contact
        <a href="mailto:kudoro@klippros.com">kudoro@klippros.com</a>.
