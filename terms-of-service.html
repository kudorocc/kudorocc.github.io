      <p class="privacy-policy-date">
        <strong>Effective date:</strong> 17.02.2026
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Company:</strong> Klippros Studios AB<br />
        <strong>Organization number:</strong> 559543-6857<br />
        <strong>Address:</strong> Södra Viktoriagatan 46A, 411 30 Gothenburg, Sweden<br />
        <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:kudoro@klippros.com">kudoro@klippros.com</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your use of the Kudoro
        mobile application (&quot;Kudoro&quot; or the &quot;App&quot;). By
        downloading, accessing, or using Kudoro, you agree to these Terms. If
        you do not agree, you must not use the App.
      </p>

      <h2>1. The Service</h2>
      <p>
        Kudoro is a mobile application that allows users to create visual
        content based on activity data retrieved from Strava. Kudoro is operated
        by Klippros Studios AB, a Swedish limited liability company (aktiebolag). Kudoro
        is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Strava.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Strava Account and Third-Party Dependency</h2>
      <p>Use of Kudoro requires:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A valid Strava account</li>
        <li>Authorization of Kudoro to access your Strava data via the Strava API</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Kudoro relies entirely on access to the Strava API. We do not control:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What data Strava makes available</li>
        <li>API rate limits</li>
        <li>API access restrictions</li>
        <li>Changes to Strava's terms or subscription model</li>
        <li>Availability of Strava's services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Certain features of Kudoro may require a paid Strava subscription.
        For more information, visit <a href="https://www.strava.com/account">Strava</a>.
        Kudoro does not control which data Strava makes available to free or
        paid Strava users. If Strava limits access, changes its API, restricts
        your data, or suspends API access, certain features of Kudoro may become
        unavailable. We are not responsible for interruptions or limitations
        caused by Strava.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Kudoro offers optional paid subscriptions within the App.
        Certain pro features may additoinally require a paid Strava subscription, not included or sold in Kudoro.
        For more information, visit <a href="https://www.strava.com/account">Strava</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Subscriptions may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monthly subscription</li>
        <li>Yearly subscription</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All subscriptions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are purchased via Apple App Store or Google Play</li>
        <li>Automatically renew unless cancelled</li>
        <li>Are billed by the respective app store</li>
        <li>Are managed through your app store account</li>
        <li>Cannot be cancelled by uninstalling the App</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Pricing, billing, cancellation, free trials, and renewal terms are
        presented in the app store purchase flow before you confirm payment.
      </p>
      <p>You can manage or cancel your subscription via:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apple: App Store → Account → Subscriptions</li>
        <li>Google: Play Store → Payments &amp; Subscriptions → Subscriptions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For step-by-step instructions on how to cancel your subscription, see
        <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039">Apple</a> and
        <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481">Google Play</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your purchases and subscriptions are also subject to the terms of your
        app store provider, including the
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/">
          Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions
        </a>
        and
        <a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms/index.html">
          Google Play subscription terms
        </a>.
      </p>
      <p>We do not process payments directly.</p>

      <h2>4. Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Purchases are made through the applicable app store. Refund requests
        must be submitted through the app store where the purchase was made.
        Refund approval is determined by Apple or Google in accordance with
        their respective policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Kudoro experiences significant service disruption caused by Strava
        API limitations that materially affect paid features, users may request
        a refund for the affected subscription period through the applicable app
        store. Refunds, if granted, are administered by the app store.
      </p>

      <h2>5. EU Right of Withdrawal</h2>
      <p>
        If you are a consumer residing in the European Union, you may have a
        statutory right of withdrawal for digital purchases. Where purchases are
        made through Apple or Google, statutory rights, including withdrawal
        rights, are administered by the respective app store in accordance with
        their policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you begin using the subscription immediately after purchase, you
        acknowledge that you may lose your right of withdrawal once digital
        content delivery has started.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Location Data and User-Generated Content</h2>
      <p>
        Kudoro allows users to create and share visual representations of
        workouts, including maps derived from Strava activity data. These maps
        may reveal:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Precise geographic routes</li>
        <li>Start and end locations</li>
        <li>Frequently visited locations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any decision to share such content is made by you at your own
        discretion. Kudoro does not modify, anonymize, or obscure location data
        retrieved from Strava. You are solely responsible for evaluating the
        privacy implications of sharing workout maps or location-based content.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data Processing</h2>
      <p>
        Kudoro retrieves Strava data via the Strava API and processes it locally
        on your device to generate visual content. We do not store your Strava
        activity data on our servers. Our handling of personal data is described
        in our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>8. License to Use the App</h2>
      <p>
        We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
        license to use Kudoro for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may
        not:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reverse engineer the App</li>
        <li>Copy or redistribute the App</li>
        <li>Circumvent subscription features</li>
        <li>Use the App in violation of applicable laws</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All intellectual property rights in Kudoro remain the property of Klippros Studios AB.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Service Availability</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to provide a stable and reliable service; however, Kudoro is provided &quot;as is&quot; without warranties.
      </p>
      <p>Certain features may become temporarily or permanently unavailable due to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strava API limitations</li>
        <li>Technical issues</li>
        <li>Maintenance</li>
        <li>Changes in third-party services</li>
        <li>Other unforeseen or external factors beyond our control</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may modify or discontinue features at any time.</p>

      <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Klippros Studios AB shall not be liable for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Indirect or consequential damages</li>
        <li>Loss of data</li>
        <li>Loss of profits</li>
        <li>Service interruptions caused by third-party services such as Strava</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nothing in these Terms limits mandatory consumer rights under applicable
        law.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate access to Kudoro if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You violate these Terms</li>
        <li>You misuse the service</li>
        <li>Required by law</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Termination does not automatically cancel active subscriptions.
        Subscriptions must be cancelled via the applicable app store.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. The most current version
        will always be available at
        <a href="https://kudoro.cc/terms-of-service"
          >https://kudoro.cc/terms-of-service</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continued use of Kudoro after changes take effect constitutes acceptance
        of the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by Swedish law. If you are a consumer residing
        in the EU, mandatory consumer protection laws in your country of
        residence may also apply.
